# SAM

Sketch-a-Map (SAM) is an attempt at creating a system that could be considered part of the domain of computational creativity (CC). The goal of SAM is to allow users to input a mood, which will then be used to select an image from its knowledge-base, 2DShapesStrcuture. SAM will then take the image it selects and attempt to create a route (GPS art) that closely resembles the image.
